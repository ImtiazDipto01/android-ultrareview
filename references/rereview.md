# Re-review protocol

A re-review verifies resolution and moves the PR toward a stable decision. It does not restart a greenfield review of unchanged code.

## Recover continuity

Collect the previous review and target tuple, score/decision, acceptance and architecture basis, P0–P2 findings, stable `B` and `E` items, validation gaps, substantive author replies, unresolved threads, and current target. Compare the code and evidence delta between the two targets.

Continuity must be recoverable from visible review/draft content. Do not hide a ledger in HTML comments, opaque metadata, or other content the user cannot reasonably inspect, and do not automatically create permanent local state. If the user explicitly authorizes an unposted continuity artifact, an optional visible JSON sidecar may mirror the target tuple, intent basis, path ledger, evidence provenance, and resolution state. Disclose its path and purpose, do not place it in the reviewed repository unless explicitly requested, and treat the public review plus current provider/repository state as authoritative when they disagree.

If prior artifacts are unavailable, disclose the continuity limit and reconstruct only from accessible evidence. If target, authority, and evidence are unchanged, perform a continuity check and stop after reporting no state change. An explicitly requested independent review may reason afresh, while still deduplicating prior threads.

## Resolve earlier topics

For each prior finding or path item, use one public resolution:

- **Fixed:** the behavior is corrected and its required evidence passes.
- **Still open:** the original failing path remains, the repair is partial, or required evidence is externally blocked. Preserve the original supported severity and explain exactly what remains.
- **No longer applies:** verified implementation context or an authorized scope decision removes the governing condition.
- **Withdrawn:** evidence shows the reviewer's factual, causal, severity, or authority premise was wrong.

Map these to path statuses: `Fixed` → `Done`, `Still open` → `Open`, `No longer applies` → `N/A`, and `Withdrawn` → `Withdrawn`. Never renumber or reuse a `B` or `E` ID.

When only a separable clause of a path condition exceeded the retained finding or controlling authority, keep the stable ID and supported core outcome, explicitly identify the clause as withdrawn, and record the corrected condition as a reviewer rubric correction. This is not silent path weakening: it is the required removal of a false blocker. Do not withdraw supported behavior merely because one appended scenario was over-broad.

When inspection shows code is repaired but verification is missing, the remaining issue is evidence, not an unresolved code defect. Keep the relevant path item open with the exact evidence needed and apply the evidence cap.

## Adjudicate author replies

Treat a reply as evidence to verify rather than automatic authority:

- withdraw or reclassify when it disproves the trigger, causal path, consequence, requirement, or severity;
- mark no longer applicable when an authorized owner changes scope;
- mark fixed only after tracing current behavior and relevant evidence;
- convert genuine intent uncertainty into a question or validation limit with the needed authority named; or
- retain a demonstrated defect with its controlling evidence.

Reference the existing thread instead of re-arguing or reposting the same issue. Author agreement is not required to correct a mistaken review, and assertion alone does not refute a demonstrated path.

## Inspect the repair delta

Focus on code changed to address prior items, affected callers/state/persistence/process/lifecycle/tests, changed requirements or base context, and regressions introduced or exposed by the repair. Confirm the complete current target remains merge-ready, but preserve prior classifications for unchanged topics.

A topic may change classification only when there is a specific material basis: changed code or integration context alters its trigger/consequence/invariant; new authoritative scope applies; new test/runtime/static causal evidence appears; or a named earlier factual/rubric error is corrected. A new SHA, new dependency/platform release, fresh preference, or stronger wording alone is insufficient.

## Admit a genuinely new P0–P2

A new blocking finding is allowed only when every condition holds:

1. it has a distinct root cause rather than reframing a ledgered topic;
2. it names a concrete trigger or required precondition in the current target;
3. it traces the current path or missing branch to an observable user, data, security, privacy, release, or engineering consequence;
4. it identifies the governing requirement or invariant when non-obvious;
5. the consequence independently meets P0–P2; and
6. it states the novelty basis: introduced/exposed by the repair, supported by new authority/evidence, or genuinely missed earlier.

Before admitting it, run the same pre-publication falsification pass required for an initial P0–P2 finding. Reopen the current anchor, inspect guards/callers/tests and counter-evidence, and withdraw or narrow the candidate when its trigger-to-consequence chain does not survive.

A concrete static causal trace can demonstrate a consequence; runtime reproduction is not mandatory. A possibility without the trigger-to-consequence chain is a question, evidence gap, or non-blocking note.

If the defect existed on the prior reviewed target, label it a newly recognized reviewer oversight. Assign the next unused `B` ID and do not imply the developer introduced it. This safety exception remains available at any round, but cannot be used for stricter interpretations, framework/architecture taste, optional cleanup, or a previously dismissed topic without new material basis.

## Preserve locked paths and stop on state

- Maintain `B` items under [scoring-and-severity.md](scoring-and-severity.md). New safety findings may append an ID only through the admission rule above.
- Maintain `E` items under [five-point-evidence.md](five-point-evidence.md). Unchanged scope cannot add or tighten the 5.0 path.
- Avoid duplicate inline threads; link a moved prior thread when a new anchor is essential.
- If validation is the only new input, verify SHA, provenance, command/job, module/variant, device/API when applicable, tests, and result. Update evidence, score, and decision without another code sweep.
- When exact-target evidence is the sole remaining baseline gate, use the validation-limited header, request no source change, and name the qualifying event.
- Review count is never a reason to approve, suppress a verified defect, or invent a new one. Material state change is the tripwire.

Recalculate the score from the complete current target rather than adding points per fix. A score can remain flat after real progress when another independent item still sets the ceiling; explain that plainly.

## Re-review output

Under `Previous findings`, group items as:

- `Fixed`
- `Still open`
- `No longer applies` when present
- `Withdrawn` when present
- `New` for findings that passed the admission rule; otherwise `None`

Then use the standard output. Report stable path IDs and only the exact open work. At 4.5, open `E` items stay optional and the recommendation is `APPROVE`. At 5.0, state that the 4.5 baseline and all applicable evidence items are complete.
